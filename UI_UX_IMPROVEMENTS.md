   - Less cramped overall

3. **Interaction Design**

   - Subtle lift animations
   - Consistent feedback across all interactive elements
   - Better mobile touch targets

4. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - Logo stands out more with gradient
   - Menu items have clear hover states
   - Donate button is prominent but not overwhelming
   - Better balance of elements

**Problem:** Button was massive, squeezing other elements
**Solution:**
- Reduced padding from `14px 32px` to `10px 20px`
- Smaller icon (`20px` ‚Üí `16px`)
- Changed from `uppercase tracking-wider` to normal case
- Removed "NOW" to make it more concise
- Result: **40% smaller** but still eye-catching

### Issue 2: Menu Feels Cramped
**Problem:** Navigation items too close together
**Solution:**
- Changed `gap-1` to proper spacing
- Added `px-3 py-2` padding to each link
- Added rounded hover backgrounds

- Result: **Much more breathable layout**

### Issue 3: Too Corporate
**Problem:** Dark teal made it feel like a business site

- Added gradient effects
- Softer shadows
- Playful hover animations
- Result: **Feels like a children's charity**

### Issue 4: Not Aligned with Brand

## Additional Color Consistency Fixes

### Complete Teal-to-Purple Migration
After the initial redesign, several teal color references remained. These have now been fully updated:

1. **Form Focus States** (`app/globals.css:313-317`)

   - **After**: Uses `var(--primary)` with purple ring
   - Better brand consistency when users interact with forms

2. **Gradient Text Classes** (`app/globals.css:348-361`)
   - **Before**: Hardcoded teal gradients `#00313C 0%, #4ECDC4 100%`
   - **After**: Uses CSS variables `var(--gradient-primary)` and `var(--gradient-secondary)`
   - Centralized color management

3. **Badge Styles** (`app/globals.css:378-386`)
   - **Before**: `bg-teal-100 text-teal-800`
   - **After**: Purple badge with `rgba(119, 36, 118, 0.1)` background
   - Secondary badge now uses yellow with proper transparency

4. **Custom Scrollbar** (`app/globals.css:429-436`)
   - **Before**: Teal gradient `#00313C 0%, #004d5c 100%`
   - **After**: Uses `var(--gradient-primary)` purple gradient
   - Even the scrollbar matches the brand!

5. **Focus Visible Ring** (`app/globals.css:477-480`)
   - **Before**: `ring-teal-500`
   - **After**: Uses `var(--primary)` purple
